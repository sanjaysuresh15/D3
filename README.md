# D3 Visualization -Healthcare and Poverty Data

I created a scatter plot that can be clicked on to access the data points for each state. D3 and Html were used to return data from the csv file and create the plot points on the graph while using the tooltip function to create the click event to show the data points for each circle on the scatter plot.
